Recently, I've been working on a [small web app][github:interjector] to enhance human communication. I name it "Interjector" because it act as someone (maybe the user themself) interjecting in a conversation or discussion. 

The basic idea was that I wanted to write a tool to help me answer questions in German. I imagine with current available technologies, it should be possible. I would use Whisper to transcribe the audio from microphone, and then use a large language model to generate the answer according to the information given in the prompt. Though Whisper is not included in current version, it turned out to have a lot of potential usage. Let's take a look: Here I played a [Google interview example][youtube:google-interview-example] video to it, and it successfully recognized the question and generated a reasonable response.

I see the possibility in the future that it could be used to answer questions in a meeting, a lecture, or a job interview. Despite the moral and ethical concerns, I think it could be a great help for people who are not good at speaking, or people who are not good at listening. For me, I'm expecting it to bring up some joke according to the context to entertain my wife. 

This is how gpt-4-turbo react to the above context in the screenshot when you force it to be humourous:

> "Why did the mathematician break up with his numbers? Because he couldn’t find a pair that added up to his expectations!"
> 
> This joke is funny in the context because it plays on the idea of finding a matching pair of numbers that sum up to a given total, similar to the task described. It humorously personifies the mathematician having relationship issues with numbers, paralleling the difficulty of finding the right pair that meets a specific requirement, just like in a human relationship.

I feel cringed. But it might be more humourous than me though. And we should look forward to the future where it will generate better jokes.

A better usage would be to help people discuss and debate, as it could provide useful background information instantly, or point out errors or faked facts and give references:

Human speak about 150 words per minute (in English). I estimate a usual session of dialog would last one hour. This means there will be less than 10k words to process. Considering the context window of current LLMs is usually 10+ times larger, we have fair enough space for the background information. 

The three-column interface is designed to help the user acquire utmost information from the conversation. It was initially consisted of the transcript, the translation, and the completion. But after realizing its potential usage, I reassigned the translation column to a summary column. So that the app is not only targeting people need to talk in foreign languages. A summary could help the user grab the information immediately and tell if the response from the completion is reasonable.

However, my original requirement cannot be fullfilled. Currently the app is using Web Speech API for speech recognition instead of Whisper. This is because Whisper itself does not process real-time audio. The Web Speech API in Google Chrome does not recognize German well. I will integrate Whisper in the future. This will enable the app to be run in other browsers as well. 

The app is still in an early stage, and I'm looking forward to your feedback.
