To all my dear friends,

Thank you for your concern. I sincerely appreciate your comfort, encouragement, advice, guidance, support, assistance, etc. In the past eight months, I've been suffering from the depressive disorder that made me less socialized which is why I have not been posting anything anywhere. But luckily with the invaluable support from all of you, I am recovering very fast. After the powerful medication, I am very fine, at least for now.

During this time I have really learned a lot. I studied psychopathology and psychopharmacology to figure out why I was ill and how the medicine can work. I talked to a lot of friends and listened to their stories and advice, which actually do not work for curing the disease, but I absorbed much experience from them. My Weltanschauung has been improved to face higher level obstacles of life.

I am so impressed by the priceless friendship. I got much more help than what I expected. According to my psychiatrist, I need to talk more with my friends. Your company has been a major part of my therapy. I appreciate your time and effort. Meanwhile, I've met several great minds, or I may say, great souls, who helped me finding myself, finding my faith.

The medication does not solve the problem but helps me build an optimistic attitude. It is the first time that I experience the immediate effect of psychiatric disease, which enfeebles one's will, destroys the fundamental thought of living. Hence I have learned how to face the depressive state, and so that I have overcome one of my shortcomings. What a valuable experience it is. Now let me "seize fate by the throat" and master my own life.

Please do not hesitate to ask me for whatever I can help, because I always know I owe all of you. And please pardon my overdue thank you. I'll try to live a normal life again as soon as possible.

I wish you would never suffer from such a disease. If you really did, I wish you were capable of resisting it. And finally thank you again. I wish you all the best. Let's cheer for the health, the friendship, the life, and the universe.

P.S. And cheer for the love.
